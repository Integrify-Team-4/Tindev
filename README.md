**###A job dating app for employer and job seeker**
Job Dating Web Application

**#Introduction:**

The project is based on research about the solution of job seeker. The problem is that there is a very late response from the 
job advertiser. For example, Job hunter is applying today, but he sometimes gets a response after a long time or sometimes he gets
a response after 6 months  or sometimes he doesn't get anything. So, the main aim of this research and the project would be to identify
the solution either by suggesting to improve their profile within a short period with more skills or calling them for the interview when
the hunter got matched as well as the employer. This project will try to solve the problem for Job Hunter whose profile is matched with the
job title and the requirements of the employer. If the skills of the job hunter are matched with the requirements of the employer, 
there would be immediate contact in between them and the further process will go on via both parties, the Job hunter and the employer.
