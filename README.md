**#Job Dating Web Application**
##Introduction
The project is based on research about the solution of job seeker. The problem is that there is a very late response from the job advertiser. For example, Job hunter is applying today, but he sometimes gets a response after a long time or sometimes he gets a response after 6 months or sometimes he doesn't get anything. So, the main aim of this research and the project would be to identify the solution either by suggesting to improve their profile/skills within a short period with more skills for the specific job or calling them for the interview when the hunter got matched with the employers' requirements. This project/application will try to solve the problem for Job Hunter whose profile is matched with the job title and the requirements of the employer. If the skills of the job hunter are matched with the requirements of the employer, there would be immediate contact in between them and the further process will go on via both parties, the Job hunter and the employer. In overall and in very short sentence, this application will work as tinder concept to avoid the gap between applicants applied data to employer's response time.
